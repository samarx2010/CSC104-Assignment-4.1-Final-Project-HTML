Be sure to comment on each section and have some kind of "dummy" content in the document so you can see your structure. There should be a sufficient amount of content to clearly show your work and intentions.

Now that you have experience creating HTML and CSS content, I expect you to stretch your skills to new areas. This HTML should look professional, have a sense of completeness like it is showing the entire picture, and show improvements that demonstrate improved skill.

Create at least 1 HTML page for your final project website. 
Elements should include a body, nav, sections, aside, footer, etc. organized appropriately
Include a description of what the page(s) output in a readme.txt
Use well-formatted, easy-to-read, and commented code
Deliverables:
All files and folders are uploaded to your GitHub repo.
Screenprint of your webpage is uploaded to Canvas, along with the link to your GitHub repo.

My webpage that I submitted is my homepage for my final project. Because I am a artist, I wanted to make a 
commission website dedicated to receiving forms for commissions through my contact me page. I have submitted my homepage only 
but I am working on the rest of the webpages as we speak.

The output is a one to one reference to my wireframes with some tweaks added to it.
